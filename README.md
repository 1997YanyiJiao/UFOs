# UFOs
# Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of the challenge is to create a webpage about UFO sightings. The webpage has a dynamic table incorporated in it. users can filter for multiple criteria at the same time. So we are assigned to help her to create table and add more filter parameters like city,shape,country.
# Results
This webpage allows users to search by five different criteria. For example, if the user types a certain data in the data filter, all UFO sightings that happened in that day will populate on the webpage.

# Summary:
While this design allows the large table of data to be narrowed down via filters, there is not an option to reset the filters. The user must refresh the webpage to clear all filters. This is not ideal. I would recommend adding a "Clear Filters" button to the webpage.
1) If clear filter button  added that would be easy for the user to reset the page

2) A filter on range  for date is a recommended criteria; example- 2010
